## How to contribute to SavageFactions

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ProSavage/SavageFactions/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ProSavage/SavageFactions/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a **snippet of the logs** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please use tabs as ident with a size of 3 spaces.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Please specify what changes you made to the formatting etc., as it allows us to get an idea of how this will change our files overall.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Discuss in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/UPyahX2) about your idea.

* Do not open a Pull Request on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

SavageFactions is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and report bugs or create pull requests!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
