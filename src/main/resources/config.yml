# Debug
# Turn this on if you are having issues with something and working on resolving them.
# This will spam your console with information that is useful if you know how to read the source.
# It's suggested that you only turn this on at the direction of a developer.
debug: false

# Prevent find factions exploit
# This will help limit how many times a player can be sent a map of factions.
# Set this to the cooldown you want, in miliseconds, for a map to be shown to a player.
# If you want to log when a player violates this (only happens on chunk enter so it shouldn't be too spammy),
#   set log to true and it will be logged to console as "player tried to show a faction map too soon and triggered exploit blocker."
findfactionsexploit:
  cooldown: 2000 # in miliseconds. 2000 = 2 seconds.
  log: false

### Hard Core Settings ###
# Many of the features that are / are to come in this section have been requested by
#   people in relation to HCF servers. All settings are set to the normal Factions
#   behavior by default.

# Default Relation allows you to change the default relation for Factions.
# Example usage would be so people can't leave then make a new Faction while Raiding
#   in order to be able to execute commands if the default relation is neutral.
# This has always been neutral.
default-relation: "neutral"

# Portal Creation
# Do you want to limit portal creation?
portals:
  limit: false # will disable the below check if set to false

  # What should the minimum relation be to create a portal in territory?
  # Goes in the order of: ENEMY, NEUTRAL, ALLY, MEMBER.
  # Minimum relation allows that and all listed to the right to create portals.
  # Example: put ALLY to allow ALLY and MEMBER to be able to create portals.
  minimum-relation: MEMBER # If typed incorrectly, defaults to NEUTRAL.

### Hard Core Settings ###

# Warps
# What should be the max amount of warps that a Faction can set?
max-warps: 5

# This is the cost section for warps.
# It will charge them each time the command would be successful. (won't charge on erroneous /f warp attempts).
# You can use decimal places here.
# If enabled is set to false, it will ignore the values.
warp-cost:
  enabled: false
  setwarp: 5
  delwarp: 5
  warp: 5

# Faction Fly
# Enable Faction Fly:
enable-faction-flight: true
ffly:
  enemy-radius-check: 1 #How frequently to check enemy radius, in seconds. Set to 0 to disable checking.
  AutoEnable: true
  CombatFlyCooldown: 10 #Cooldown in seconds for someone being in combat before their fly is automatically re-enabled
  enemies-near-disable-flight: true #This means F Stealth Will Be Redundant
  disable-flight-on-generic-damage: false #Any Damage a Player Takes Their Flight Will Be Disabled
  disable-flight-on-mob-damage: false #Any Damage a Player Takes From A Mob Their Flight Will Be Disabled
  disable-flight-on-player-damage: true

# If a player leaves fly (out of territory or took damage)
# how long should they not take fall damage for?
# Set to 0 to have them always take fall damage.
fly-falldamage-cooldown: 10

# Pistons
# Should we disable pistons in Faction territory? This will prevent people from doing something like:
# http://i.gyazo.com/6a1a31222e58a5d60ff341c13f6a8404.gif
disable-pistons-in-territory: false

# ToolTips
# This section is to configure tooltips for things like /f list
tooltips:

  # List
  # This shows up when someone does /f list for the top factions.
  # It will not sure up for factionless of course, just actual factions.
  # You can use color codes here.
  list:
    - "&6&l* &eLeader: &7{leader}"
    - "&6&l* &eClaims: &7{chunks}"
    - "&6&l* &ePower: &7{power}/{maxPower}"
    - "&6&l* &eMembers: &7{online}/{members}"

  # Show
  # This shows up when someone does /f show.
  # It adds tooltips to each player in the list here, nothing else.
  # {group} will show the players primary group if you have vault installed.
  # {balance} will show their balance if you have vault installed.
  # {lastSeen} will show human readable info on when the player was last seen, or online.
  show:
    - "&6&l* &eUsername: &7{name}"

    - "&6&l* &eLast Seen:&7 {lastSeen}"
    - "&6&l* &ePower: &7{player-power}/{player-maxpower}"

# Configuration section for Scoreboards
# This will allow you to completely customize how your scoreboards look.
# Make sure that no lines are duplicates of each other otherwise only the first will display.
# Use &0-9a-f for colors and include messages in "quotes"
scoreboard:

  # send faction change message as well when scoreboard is up?
  also-send-chat: true
  # How long do we want scoreboards to stay if set temporarily.
  expiration: 7

  # FInfo scoreboard is displayed when a player walks into a new Faction's territory.
  # Scoreboard disappears after <expiration> seconds.
  # Things to be replaced in this:
  # {power} - faction's power. {chunks} - total claimed chunks. {members} - total members.
  # {online} - online members. {leader} - faction's leader. {open} - shows either true or false if open.
  # {raidable} - true if the faction can be claimed over, otherwise false.
  # {warps} - the number of warps that a faction has set.
  # The title of the scoreboard will be the Faction's tag and colored according to the relation with the player's Faction.
  # Commenting this section out will cause the info to appear in chat as the plugin originally did.

    - "&bTerritory"
    - "{chunks}"

  # Default board that will always show up if a player wants it to.
  # This can show any arbitrary text or you can use a lot of variables to replace things.
  # Replace {name} - player's name. {faction} - player's faction title, factionless if none.
  # {totalOnline} - total players on the server. {balance} - player's balance.
  # {maxPower} - player's max power.
  # {powerBoost} - player's powerboost.

#################### HCF Features ####################
######################################################
# These features were requested as part of Hardcore Factions or something.
# All of them are disabled by default.

# Max Relation Types
# Limits factions to having a max number of each relation.
# Setting to 0 means none allowed. -1 for disabled.
# This will have no effect on default or existing relations, only when relations are changed.
# It is advised that you set the default relation to -1 so they can always go back to that.
# Otherwise Factions could be stuck with not being able to unenemy other Factions.
max-relations:
  enabled: true
  ally: 1
  truce: 0
  neutral: -1
  enemy: -1

# WorldBorder support
# A buffer of 0 means faction claims can go right up to the border of the world.
# The buffer is in chunks, so 1 as a buffer means an entire chunk of buffer between
# the border of the world and what can be claimed to factions
world-border:
  buffer: 0

# Raids
# Allow a faction to be raided if they have more land than power.
# This will make claimed territory lose all protections
#   allowing factions to open chests, break blocks, etc. if they
#   have claimed chunks >= power.
hcf:
  raidable: false

  # DTR (death til raidable) will be in /f show if enabled. Configure the message in the lang.yml
  dtr: false

  # Should we allow Factions to over claim if they are raidable (above has no effect on this)?
  # This has always been true, allowing factions to over claim others.
  allow-overclaim: true

  # Power Freeze
  # After a player dies, how long should the faction not be able to regen power?
  # This resets on each death but does not accumulate.
  # Set to 0 for no freeze. Time is in seconds.
  powerfreeze: 0

  # Buffer Zone
  # Buffer Zone is an chunk area required between claims of different Factions.
  # This is default to 0 and has always been that way. Meaning Factions can have
  #   claims that border each other.
  # If this is set to 3, then Factions need to have 3 chunks between their claim
  #   and another Faction's claim.
  # It's recommended to keep this pretty low as the radius check could be a
  #   heavy operation if set to a large number.
  # If this is set to 0, we won't even bother checking which is how Factions has
  #   always been.
  buffer-zone: 0

  stuck:
    Enabled: false
    delay: 30
    radius: 10
